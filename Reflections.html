            <b>Reflection 1: </b> <br>

    Recently, my heart and mind have been tormented by a whirlwind of emotions. The murder of George Floyd first came to my attention when a friend sent me a video of a Black man and a White cop that I did not know and said, “this makes me so sad”. Since then I have learned their names and have used them to call for justice. I have felt overwhelmed with sadness, grief, anger, shock, disbelief and disappointment and have been left with many questions. How could this still be happening? Why is the world so cruel? What can I do to help? As one small person in such a big world, how can I make a difference? How can we make a difference and build a better future together? <br><br>
            Throughout that week I felt bombarded by news, information, and tragedy. I was overwhelmed. My emotional cup was overflowing. I wanted so desperately to help and make a difference but did not want to put myself or my family in danger in the midst of a pandemic. Struggling to find the reliable information in the waves of various media coverage and to find a role in which I could contribute without risking my family’s health, I found myself feeling lost in a dark place without much hope. <br><br>
That is when the curated music playlist project was brought to our attention. It drew me in because I felt like it could really be a tool to express the pains and joys of fighting against an unjust system. Hopefully, it would help myself and others learn something too. So far, the playlist has helped capture every emotion flying at me. There are songs dreaming of future joys, songs lamenting the current state of the world, songs of pride, and songs of pain. The playlist represents all the emotions that accompany a revolution, all the emotions that we are feeling. We are living through a revolution. <br><br>
One of the songs that really reached me during this time was “Where Is The Love?” by the Black-Eyed Peas. I heard it on the radio, overlapped by messages of strength and support from prominent artists and celebrities. In that moment, that song and the words of those people really touched me. Yes, this is how I had been feeling. It is difficult to see the love when the world seems to be so consumed by hate. Yet the more I looked, the more I saw it. I saw so many beautiful, different people standing together in solidarity and supporting one another. I saw dancing, art, music, flowers and more. There were protest dogs, protest families, and even a protest wedding. How powerful that even in the darkest of times people find a way to come together and spread the light. Although it may feel like there are many cruel and hateful people in the world, there are just as many good and caring people in the world too. So where is the love? The love is all around. Even when there is no finish line in sight and it feels like the world as we know it is coming to an end, there is still love and there will always be people continuing to fight for it.    <br><br>

<b>Reflection 2: </b> <br><br>
The Past couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster of emotions, so reflection is something I think we could all use. Personally, I've felt a mixture of emotions: Sadness, frustration, apprehensiveness, anxiousness, disgust, disappointment, worry etc. The list goes on. Out of all of these, disgust, sadness and apprehensiveness take first, second and third place for me. I am completely aware of the large amount of protests and action being taken, and while all of this is great, the big question is: how do we move forward and make society better and safer from here for the black communities or any underrepresented community across the country? We obviously still have a lot of work to do, but with an election close by, I feel like the opportunity for major change couldn't be better.  I watched The George Floyd funeral that took place in houston, and I thought the ceremony was powerful. The ceremony demonstrated just how strongly the black community is connected with music as it was used throughout the entire service. It added an entirely new level of power to the speeches that were given, and it definitely generated reactions from the audience. It was an excellent demonstration of how black performers and speakers engaged with the audience which is a characteristic I've seen discussed in some of our readings for class. <br> <br>
            
<b> Reflection 3: </b> <br> <br>
Over the past few weeks, some emotions I have felt include frustration, sadness, belittlement, fear, and hope. The past few weeks have been what I would consider a great starting point for future change, even if people won’t accept the systematic reasons that this change must happen, at least these we’ve begun a conversation. I was personally very unaware of the many issues surrounding racism and systematic oppression before furthering my education at Southwestern so I understand what it’s like to be ignorant of these issues. I understand that it’s easier to place individual blame and make excuses than to become uncomfortable and frustrated with the oppressive system we’ve built. I believe the best thing I’ve gotten out of my education at Southwestern so far, is this very feeling of discomfort. After becoming aware of the system of oppression we’ve built and uphold, I was upset that these issues hadn’t been brought to my attention before, and I think that through these issues taking center stage, many people might be experiencing the same disappointment. <br> <br>
I’ve felt frustrated when sharing my knowledge of the issues of racism and systematic oppression with members of my family who choose to place individual and cultural blame on the victims of our oppressive system. I’ve felt sadness knowing that this incident of injustice is not the first, nor will it be the last. I’ve felt belittlement when retelling shared experiences of blatant racism with members of my family and being told “I don’t believe that actually happened”. I’ve felt fear for what might come out of all of this. I’ve felt fear for the peaceful protesters who are on the front lines risking everything for this cause. I’ve felt hopeful that this will bring about positive change. I hope that people continue to challenge the beliefs of the ignorant. I hope that people continue to fight against incidents of injustice. I hope that people will be held accountable for their actions. I hope that people will be held accountable for their words. I hope that future generations won’t have to feel disappointed that the education system has failed to include the history and the narrative of those who are oppressed.  <br> <br>
Most of the music I have listened to during this time has been music we’ve discussed in class as well as music I’ve found relating to the concept of music as resistance. Through this course we’ve learned that African Americans use music as a way to freely express themselves, communicate, and resist the system of oppression that tries so hard to diminish their culture. One of the best ways to understand a group is to get to know their culture and I’ve learned that music is an integral component of African American culture. I think that everyone should spend some time educating themselves on the culture and history of African Americans in order to fully understand the racism and systematic oppression being experienced by African Americans and get a better understanding of why people are so angry with the system we’ve built and uphold. Music is something that is often overlooked or taken for granted because it’s become so interwoven with our lifestyle. We listen to music in our cars on the way to work, we listen to music while walking to class, we listen to music while sitting in restaurants, we even listen to music while waiting in elevators, so why not use music as a means to better understand the people who, for hundreds of years, have ached for our understanding?   <br> <br>


<b> Reflection 4: </b> <br> <br>
Over the course of the past several weeks my emotions have been all over the place.
On one hand, I feel so energized by the mass movement of people. I attended my very first protest, wore my doc martens, walked a total of 4 miles, came out with multiple blisters and hella sore legs, but it felt right. I was with my sisters, and part of me was being protective so I kept us away from the riot line, but I felt such a strong pull. It felt right, being there. It felt good. <br> <br>
On the other hand, I am so tired because people still are so ignorant, and like my mom, some refuse to educate themselves or be open to new understandings. If you aren’t mad, then you just must not care. Because what’s happening now is far bigger than George Floyd, bigger than Trump, and left and right- it’s been building for hundreds of years. Floyd’s death was merely a final straw, it’s the tip of the iceberg. The music that I have listened to during this time includes a lot of grandson, because I’ve been thinking about their music a lot recently. Thoughts and Prayers, a song about gun violence and political corruption, War about racism, Die Young says “My Presidnets a neo-nazi / Don’t listen to them, you’re not free”. And of course, the song 6:00, from 2018, a song whose lyrics are still fresh: <br> <br>
“Till we get reciprocity <br>
How can we stand by? <br>
Yesterday, I turned on the TV <br>
I saw another man down <br>
He was screaming <br>
He can't breathe no more <br>
He held his hands high <br>
But then he got struck down <br>
Oh, he got struck down” <br><br>
