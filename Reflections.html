            Reflection 1: <br>

“    Recently, my heart and mind have been tormented by a whirlwind of emotions. The murder of George Floyd first came to my attention when a friend sent me a video of a Black man and a White cop that I did not know and said, “this makes me so sad”. Since then I have learned their names and have used them to call for justice. I have felt overwhelmed with sadness, grief, anger, shock, disbelief and disappointment and have been left with many questions. How could this still be happening? Why is the world so cruel? What can I do to help? As one small person in such a big world, how can I make a difference? How can we make a difference and build a better future together? <br><br>
            Throughout that week I felt bombarded by news, information, and tragedy. I was overwhelmed. My emotional cup was overflowing. I wanted so desperately to help and make a difference but did not want to put myself or my family in danger in the midst of a pandemic. Struggling to find the reliable information in the waves of various media coverage and to find a role in which I could contribute without risking my family’s health, I found myself feeling lost in a dark place without much hope. <br><br>
That is when the curated music playlist project was brought to our attention. It drew me in because I felt like it could really be a tool to express the pains and joys of fighting against an unjust system. Hopefully, it would help myself and others learn something too. So far, the playlist has helped capture every emotion flying at me. There are songs dreaming of future joys, songs lamenting the current state of the world, songs of pride, and songs of pain. The playlist represents all the emotions that accompany a revolution, all the emotions that we are feeling. We are living through a revolution. <br><br>
One of the songs that really reached me during this time was “Where Is The Love?” by the Black-Eyed Peas. I heard it on the radio, overlapped by messages of strength and support from prominent artists and celebrities. In that moment, that song and the words of those people really touched me. Yes, this is how I had been feeling. It is difficult to see the love when the world seems to be so consumed by hate. Yet the more I looked, the more I saw it. I saw so many beautiful, different people standing together in solidarity and supporting one another. I saw dancing, art, music, flowers and more. There were protest dogs, protest families, and even a protest wedding. How powerful that even in the darkest of times people find a way to come together and spread the light. Although it may feel like there are many cruel and hateful people in the world, there are just as many good and caring people in the world too. So where is the love? The love is all around. Even when there is no finish line in sight and it feels like the world as we know it is coming to an end, there is still love and there will always be people continuing to fight for it.   ” <br><br>

Reflection 2: <br><br>
The Past couple of weeks have been a rollercoaster of emotions, so reflection is something I think we could all use. Personally, I've felt a mixture of emotions: Sadness, frustration, apprehensiveness, anxiousness, disgust, disappointment, worry etc. The list goes on. Out of all of these, disgust, sadness and apprehensiveness take first, second and third place for me. I am completely aware of the large amount of protests and action being taken, and while all of this is great, the big question is: how do we move forward and make society better and safer from here for the black communities or any underrepresented community across the country? We obviously still have a lot of work to do, but with an election close by, I feel like the opportunity for major change couldn't be better.  I watched The George Floyd funeral that took place in houston, and I thought the ceremony was powerful. The ceremony demonstrated just how strongly the black community is connected with music as it was used throughout the entire service. It added an entirely new level of power to the speeches that were given, and it definitely generated reactions from the audience. It was an excellent demonstration of how black performers and speakers engaged with the audience which is a characteristic I've seen discussed in some of our readings for class.
