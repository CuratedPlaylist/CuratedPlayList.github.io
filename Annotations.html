            Genre: Rap <br>
            This is J Cole's newest song in response to the 2020 BLM movement. It talks about how people look up to him and how he along with other celebrities need to step up and be the voice that people need. J Cole is hands down top 3 of the best rappers of this era. He is lyrically a genius so for him to put out this song it just goes to show that he cares and that people will listen and respond to it.

            Genre: Gospel <br>
            Produced for the 2019 film “Harriet”, which depicts the life story of Harriet Tubman and her role in helping slaves escape to freedom through the Underground Railroad, this song highlights the strength it took to rebel against the terrible institution of slavery. Resistance is seen in the lyrics, calling for people to stand up and fight against oppression in order to create a better life for each other despite the costs. It includes some musical Africanisms, such as humming and clapping, which foster a sense of community and the power and freedom that comes with that.

            Genre: HipHop/Rap <br>
            Released during a time of political and social unrest, this song depicts the difficulty of Black life in America. With the juxtaposition of happy, upbeat choruses and the dark, aggressive verses, we get a glimpse of the harsh reality that may face. The music video is particularly important, with imagery alluding to that of Jim Crow, religious affect, and police violence. It was chosen not only due to its important and unique sound and imagery but also due to its popularity and significance to our current state in America.

            Genre: Alt <br>
            A direct response to the epidemic of police violence and brutality, this song captures the pain expressed by so many against the people meant to protect us, echoing the final words of Eric Garner in the chorus, “I can’t breathe”, a simple sentence that haunts us all. The music video includes corrupt cops framing and terrorizing black men. It was chosen because it reminds us how normalized state violence against black bodies is, even though no one in particular was mentioned, they didn't have to be.

            Written in response to the deadly shootings across the country, released in the wake of the infamous Parkland shooting, this song addresses the state of gun violence in America, and the bloody and corrupt politics and politicians behind it. It was chosen because of the harsh reality it accurately depicts, and the repetition of the pointless platitudes often muttered after a shooting.
